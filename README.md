# macOS Compatibility Script
This script will check the hardware model ID of the Mac you run it on, then will output the maximum major OS version it is compatible with, such as 10.15 (Catalina), 13 (Monterey) etc.  
Compatible to check for max OSes of 10.11 up to 14. 15 (Sequoia) coming soon.

## How to Run
This script can be run directly on a Mac or placed into your MDM as a custom fact (Addigy) or similar.
